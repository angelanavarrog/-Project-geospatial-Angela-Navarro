# Project Geospatial



## Ojective

The goal of this project is to **propose an office location** where some given criteria are met and where the given company **size is 87 employees**.

## Procedure



## Procedure


For this purpose, I have selected from a dataset that contains information about some companies' offices, the one that meets the following filters:

- **Assumption of number of employees of 90:** Currently, a huge number of companies have implanted a work from home policy but, additionally the company expect to increase their employees number in the future, so being continously changing the location would be counterproductive.

- **Selecttion of New York City** as the place to locate the office as it is the USA city with more ***Starbucks***.

From the original given , the **selected criteria** to determine our location are:

- Proximity to ***Starbucks establishments*** near the office. 
- Availability of ***Vegan restaurants*** .
- At least one ***basketball stadium*** within 10 km of the office.
- ***Place to go party*** located nearby.
- Availability of ***shuttle services for travel***.

## Conclusion

After selected an unique location in NYC, could we propose our location as the final ubication of the office?
